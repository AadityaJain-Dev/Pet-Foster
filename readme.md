### About Project:

Pet-Foster is a side project by Aditya Jain, the aim of this project is to build a platform for communities which are trying to help animals by taking care of them & finding them a foster homes. The problem I see in currently system is most of the processes are done via Facebook or Whatsapp groups & there is no central node where you will find all the info.

I want to solve that issue with this project, I want to make a web app which would be one stop solution for all your needs.

##### This web app will have features like

- Success Stories.

- Donation / Fund raising

- Filter based on Location, category, age, species etc..

- Inquiry forms

- FAQs & Guide

- Blogs

- Need help

- Info about adoption process

- & many more.

Of course the first versin will not have all of those features, for the first version I am planning just to include 2 pets category (cat & dog), filter options & basic information about the pet & info of person to contact for adoption.

#### What is animal fostering?

It means bringing in a cat or dog, a bird or a piglet, or any other homeless pet and nurturing them for a while until they are dispatched to a permanent home with a family.

#### Tech Stack

I am planning to use React for frontend & use a hybrid of google sheets & firestore to store data.
